// Migration: workspaces_reconcile_missing_rows  (NON-TRANSACTIONAL -- batched data pass)
//
// Workspaces Release 2a, before step 1 (design: .agents/skills/learnings/work/workspaces/design.md
// §4). Reconciles every account that holds NO row of kortix.workspaces at all
// (legacy_account_id = the account): invariants I9 and I12 report each one. The
// next files build the unique index on workspaces(legacy_account_id) and the twin
// foreign keys into it; their VALIDATE fails on a row whose account has no row
// here. Reconcile first, validate after (learning 2026-08-19T182307Z).
//
// Prod read-only, 2026-11-11: 1 account (created 2026-04, no project row, no
// member). Every other account has its row. The R1 reconcile body that could
// drop a row (delete-then-insert) was replaced by 20261111135934314.
//
// batched-dml: each statement reconciles at most 500 accounts and commits on
// its own (pgm.noTransaction). Row locks only: the reconcile takes FOR NO KEY
// UPDATE on each account row of its batch and writes only kortix.workspaces.
// The candidate scan is one anti-join over accounts (~50k rows) per batch.
//
// Idempotent: a rerun finds no account without a row and does nothing.
//
// Mixed-version deploy: the R1 image never names kortix.workspaces; the R2a
// image reads it through the store, which already answers from the table.
//
// ROLL BACK: none needed (the rows are what the R1 triggers would write on the
// account's next change).
