/**
 * Keeps what a person types while the project home is still loading.
 *
 * Until the home composer's editor exists, the page has no input: first the
 * loading frame (`ProjectPendingScreen`), then the shell while the lazy editor
 * mounts. Under a slow API that lasts seconds, and every key typed in it
 * reached `<body>` and was lost (product audit F-023: 13 of 15 words lost at
 * 12 s of API latency).
 *
 * Printable keys and Backspace aimed at `<body>` now build a buffer, stored
 * as a `restoreDraft` prefill in `useComposerPrefillStore`. Each key writes
 * the WHOLE buffer, so whichever write the home composer's host consumes last
 * (`ProjectHome`, or `SpaceView` when home opens a chat) carries every key;
 * the composer appends it to the restored draft once the editor exists. An
 * empty buffer is written too, so Backspace can take back a write that was
 * already consumed. The buffer resets once the editor exists.
 *
 * Only keys whose target is `<body>` are taken: a focused button or link
 * (an access-gate screen, the sidebar) keeps its own keys, Space included.
 * A prompt handed over by another surface (desktop Quick Entry, `?q=`) wins:
 * once one appears, the buffer stops until the editor exists, even after the
 * host consumed it from the store.
 *
 * A layout effect, not a passive one: React runs child passive effects before
 * the parent's, so `ProjectHome` (a child) could consume a handed-over
 * prompt before a passive subscription here saw it.
 *
 * The handover latch lives in a ref, so StrictMode's dev re-run of the effect
 * keeps it after `ProjectHome` consumed the prompt.
 *
 * The entry is not dropped when the route leaves the home: home redirects to
 * `/chat` when chats are on, and `SpaceView` consumes it there. Known edge:
 * keys typed on an access-gate screen, followed by leaving the project before
 * any home composer mounts, land in that project's home composer on a later
 * visit in the same tab.
 *
 * The buffer belongs to the person who typed it. When the signed-in user
 * changes without a page load (another tab signs out, or signs in as someone
 * else), the entry is dropped before the next viewer's composer can read it.
 * Only a different signed-in id counts: `null` is the session still resolving
 * (a hard load, or the auth bootstrap flickering), the window this buffer
 * exists for. A sign-out from this tab reloads the page (`performSignOut`),
 * which empties the in-memory store anyway.
 *
 * Mounted by `ProjectAccessBoundary`, which stays mounted from the first
 * paint to the composer. Keys typed before React hydrates are not seen.
 * Enter is ignored: nothing is sent from a screen the person cannot see.
 * Shortcuts (Cmd, Ctrl, Alt) and IME composition pass through untouched.
