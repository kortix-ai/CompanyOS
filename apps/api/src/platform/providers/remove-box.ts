 * Remove one provider box and prove it is gone. A remove that fails because the

 * removed: the provider is asked for its status and only `removed` counts.
 * `error` is the remove failure, left to the caller's own logging and escalation.
 *
 * Its own module, not `index.ts`: many suites replace the registry module with
 * a `getProvider`-only mock, which would strip this export from every importer.
