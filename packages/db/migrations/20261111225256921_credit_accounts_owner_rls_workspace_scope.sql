-- Migration: credit_accounts_owner_rls_workspace_scope
--
-- Workspaces Release 2a, step 7: the RLS policy that lets an account owner
-- read and manage its wallet row through PostgREST reads the owner grant in
-- the workspace form too (`scope_type = 'workspace'`, see
-- 20261111225252914_role_assignments_workspace_scope). The policy already
-- requires the role's own scope to be 'account' and no object, so the rule
-- reduces to accepting 'workspace'. Its own file: credit_accounts is hot, and
-- ALTER POLICY takes a short ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock on it.
--
-- mixed-version-safe: the new USING is the old one OR a disjunct that is false
-- for every existing row; no row has scope_type 'workspace' until Release 2b.
