/**
 * The per-credential request limit on every model route of this service. It
 * runs before the body is read and before the admit call to the API.
 *
 * Sandboxes can call this service directly (`LLM_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` on the
 * API). Their requests then skip the API's `/v1/llm` limit. This applies the
 * same limit under the same setting, `KORTIX_LLM_GATEWAY_REQS_PER_MIN`
 * (default 600 per minute per credential).
 *
 * The limit runs before `authenticate()`, so it cannot tell a real credential
 * from a fabricated one. A credential the API has answered with a principal is
 * real and keeps its own bucket, keyed on the credential's SHA-256 so no raw
 * secret stays in memory. Every other credential is charged to ONE shared
 * bucket, given by `unvalidatedPerMinute` (order of magnitude above one
 * credential's own budget), whatever its value: a caller that sends a fresh
 * made-up bearer per request cannot buy a private bucket each time, so the
 * shared allowance bounds how many requests reach the API unverified (CWE-770)
 * and the bucket map cannot grow one entry per request. One source can spend
 * only a small fraction of that allowance (its own bucket, keyed on the
 * address the Cloudflare edge overwrites), so a single caller cannot pin the
 * shared bucket and deny every not-yet-validated credential its first
 * admission. `validated(credential)` moves a real credential onto its own
 * budget and gives back the shared slot it took, once, so real traffic does
 * not drain the allowance every new credential shares; the set of charged
 * credentials that makes the refund one-time is capped, so neither it nor the
 * bucket map grows with the flood. A request without a credential is not
 * counted: the pipeline refuses it with 401 before it calls the API. The cost
 * this accepts: a credential's first request spends a shared slot, refunded
 * when the API validates it, so a flood large enough to spend the whole shared
 * allowance can refuse a real credential still waiting on that first
 * validation until the window refills. That is the trade for a bounded,
 * unauthenticated allowance.
 *
 * Each gateway task counts alone, so the fleet allows limit × tasks. This
 * stops a runaway loop or a flood on one credential. It is not a quota.
 *
 * Returns the 429 response, or null when the request may continue.
