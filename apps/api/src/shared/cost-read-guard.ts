// Allows one cost-explorer window scan at a time on this API process. Each of
// /v1/usage/session-costs, /cost-by-project and /cost-summary aggregates every
// gateway_request_logs row of its window and runs 4 to 6 statements in parallel
// (cost-rollups.ts), against a pool of DEFAULT_DB_POOL_MAX = 6 connections. A
// single read can therefore fill the pool, so the bound is per replica, not per
// account: reads run one after another, up to COST_READ_MAX_WAITING queue behind
// the running one and any further read is refused at once with a retryable 429
// (the workspace heatmap issues up to 25 summary reads together; the UI retries
// the 429 itself, see retryCostReadBusy in packages/ui). Waiting reads hold no connection. On
// 2026-11-13 one caller sent 149 session-costs reads in under six minutes; the
// SDK retried every 503 twice, the pool saturated and unrelated routes missed
// the 25 s request deadline (a 3 minute API-wide brownout).
//
// The permit is released when the read SETTLES, not when the request deadline
// answers 503: the deadline does not cancel the statements, so a permit freed
// at the 503 would let the pool fill with orphaned scans anyway.
