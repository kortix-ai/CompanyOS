 * (native component `RNSFormSheetHost`). Two conditions:
 * - iOS. Android keeps gorhom.
 * - The running binary registered `RNSFormSheetHost`. It is compiled only with
 *   `RNS_GAMMA_ENABLED=1` (`ios/Podfile`, set by expo-router), and
 *   `runtimeVersion` is a fixed string, so an OTA update can reach a binary
 *   built without it. That binary keeps gorhom.
 *
 * Native detents are fractions of the sheet's maximum height
 * (`UISheetPresentationControllerDetentResolutionContext.maximumDetentValue`),
 * strictly ascending, or the single value `'fitToContents'`. The native side
 * rejects `fitToContents` next to any other detent
 * (`RNSAreDetentsValid` in `RNSFormSheetDetentResolver.mm`): it falls back to
 * one large detent. So a content-sized sheet cannot also list a full detent.
 *
 * Pure (no React Native import), so bun test loads it.
