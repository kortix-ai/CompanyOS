# Fill the brand skill from the site

The onboarding agent runs this once with the person, and again when the
site's look changes. A triggered run never runs it.

## 1. Read what exists

Read only. Never print an env file.

1. In the repository:
   - brand or design folders: `brand/`, `design/`, `.agents/skills/*brand*`,
     `.claude/skills/*brand*`, a voice or style guide;
   - logo files: `*logo*.svg`, `*logo*.png`, `favicon.*`,
     `apple-touch-icon.*`, under `public/`, `static/` or `assets/`;
   - theme files: `tailwind.config.*`, `globals.css`, `theme.*`,
     `tokens.json`, CSS custom properties such as `--color-*`;
   - fonts: `@font-face`, `next/font`, Google Fonts links;
   - the newest 3 blog posts and the newest changelog entries.
2. On the live site (`site.url`), open the home page, one blog post and the
   pricing or product page. Use `scrape_webpage`, or `agent-browser` when the
   page needs JavaScript. Record:
   - the `<title>`, the meta description and the `og:image`;
   - the computed colors of the body, the headings and the primary button,
     and the font families (`agent-browser eval` with `getComputedStyle`).
3. A brand skill or voice guide already in the repository: reuse it. With
   the person's yes, point `marketing.json` `brand.*` at those files instead
   of copying them.

## 2. Fill the files

- `visual.md`: logos with real paths, colors with their source token, fonts
  with their source, the image direction from 2 existing images.
- `voice.md`: the reader, the tone from 3 passages of the site, the product
  terms as the site spells them, the banned list. Show the person the draft
  and ask what is wrong. Write their answer in, word for word.
- `claims.md`: 5 to 20 rows, each with a proof URL you opened.
- `marketing.json` `brand.logos` and `brand.fonts`: the same paths.

## 3. Prove it

1. Render one test card with the `design` skill: 1200×630, the product name
   on the brand background, the real logo.
2. Show it to the person. Fix the files until they say it looks like their
   brand.
3. Remove every marker: `grep -rn "TODO(onboarding)" .kortix/marketing/`
   prints nothing.
